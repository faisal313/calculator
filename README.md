Things I have learnt/need to remember during this coding project
1) Use a mixture of grid and flexbox to style as both are useful
2) Location of functions etc. is extremely important! Things that you thought would work may not be due to where it is nested
3) If you change a name of a variable, you must update the name in every single part of the Js code
4) Test things in the console and codepen/repl.it to see if it is a reproducible problem
5) Use DOM manipulation to update what is displayed on screen (render functions)
6) set empty variables to equal empty string if you want to use them in checks later (can't use undefined as easily from what I saw)
